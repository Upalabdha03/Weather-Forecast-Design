# Weather-Forecast-Design


This is a C program that allows the user to store and retrieve weather data. It uses a struct called "weather" to store information about a specific date, including temperature, humidity, and pressure. The program provides a menu with four options: add weather data, display all weather data, search for weather data by date, and exit.
